## Installation

Some `homebrew` and `npm` knowledge is required:

1. Install `xcode` and the apple developer tools
2. Install `homebrew`. The installation instructions are on the `homebrew` homepage
3. Install the following `homebrew` formulas:
   - `node@x` (whatever version we happen to be at)
   - `awscli`
   - `git`
   - `mongodb`
4. Install the following npm packages globally:
   - `@angular/cli`
   - `lerna`
   - `nativescript`
5. Setup the ssh keys for github
6. Clone the repo anywhere you desire. I suggest inside `~/dev/`
